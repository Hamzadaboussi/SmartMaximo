## Project Overview

### Problem
On-site technicians often face complex issues requiring expert assistance. Traditional methods involve sending an expert to the site, resulting in inefficiencies in time, cost, and resource allocation.

### Solution
This project introduces a cross-platform mobile application to optimize technician work order management. Key features include:

#### Enhanced Work Order Visualization
- **Comprehensive Schedule:** Clear overview of assigned work orders and deadlines.
- **Detailed Information:** In-depth details on each task, including instructions and supporting documents.

#### Integrated Video Calling
- **Remote Assistance:** Real-time peer-to-peer communication for remote troubleshooting and repairs.
- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Two-way video and audio interaction for efficient problem-solving.
- **Call Control:** Manage camera, microphone, recording, and screen sharing during calls.
- **Call History and Data Archiving:** Review past consultations for future reference.

## Actors

- **User:** Manages work orders and assigns tasks.
- **Technician:** Executes work orders and utilizes app features for on-site support.
- **Expert:** Provides remote guidance and assistance through video calls.
